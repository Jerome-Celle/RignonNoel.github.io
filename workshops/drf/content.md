# 1 - REST API Quick Tips

1. HTTP Verbs
2. HTTP Response Codes
3. Resource Names
 
To having a RESTful services, we need to nembrace the HTTP specification

---

## 1.1 - HTTP Verbs

We use principally 4 HTTP verbs as follows:

#### - GET
Read a specific resource (by an identifier) or a collection of resources.

#### - PUT
Update a specific resource (by an identifier) or a collection of resources.

#### - DELETE
Remove/delete a specific resource by an identifier.

#### - POST
Create a new resource.

---

## 1.1 - HTTP Verbs

#### Note

* GET requests must not change any underlying resource data. 

* PUT Can also be used to create a specific resource if the resource identifier is know before-hand.

* POST is also a catch-all verb for operations that don't fit into the other categories.

---

## 1.2 - HTTP Response Codes

* Response status codes are part of the HTTP specification. 

* HTTP Response Code address the most common situations.

* Our Web APIs should return relevant HTTP status codes. 

---

## 1.2 - HTTP Response Codes

#### 2xx Success
The client's request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

#### 3xx Redirection
Further action needs to be taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the request.

#### 4xx Client Error
The client seems to have erred.

#### 5xx Server Error
The server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the request. 

---

## 1.2 - HTTP Response Codes

###Example of commons HTTP Response Codes:

#### 200 - OK
The request has succeeded.

#### 201 - CREATED
The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.

#### 202 - ACCEPTED
If the action cannot be carried out immediately, the server SHOULD respond with 202 (Accepted) response instead.


---

## 1.3 - Resource Names

 - Resource naming is the most important concept in Web service API.
  - Big difference of understanding

  - Little effort to setup

 - We need to create an URL hierarchy representing sensible resources.

 - Ressources need to be in plural 


---


## 1.3 - Resource Names

### Example :

#### `GET http://www.example.com/customers/123/orders/`

--

 - List orders of customer id 123

--

#### `GET http://www.example.com/customers/123/orders/456`

--

 - Get order 456 of customer 123

--

#### `POST http://www.example.com/customers/123/orders/`

--

 - Create a new order for customer 123


---


# 2 - Django Rest Framework

1. Serializers
2. Views (Generics CBVs)
 
--


 - Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.

--
	
 - Extensive documentation, and great community support.

## 2.1 - Serializer

```python
class CreateUserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):


   ...
```

Basically you can :

 - Define a custom serializer : serializers.Serializer
 - Use a model serializer : serializers.ModelSerializer
---

## 2.1 - Serializer


```python
class CreateUserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    


    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ('id', 'is_staff', 'email', 'username', 'password')
```

First need it's to to define the list of fields you want.

---

## 2.1 - Serializer

```python
class CreateUserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
   


    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ('id', 'is_staff', 'email', 'username', 'password')
        read_only_fields = ('id', 'is_staff')
        extra_kwargs = {'password': {'write_only': True}}
```

In some case you need restricted access on a data: 

 - In read-only (ex: identifier)
 - In write-only (ex: password)

---

## 2.1 - Serializer

```python
class CreateUserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
 
    url = serializers.CharField(source='get_absolute_url', read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ('id', 'is_staff', 'email', 'username', 'password', 'url')
        read_only_fields = ('id', 'is_staff')
        extra_kwargs = {'password': {'write_only': True}}
```

Sometime, you need to add a new field on your serializer or just change the default field.

---

## 2.1 - Serializer

```python
class CreateUserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
 
    url = serializers.CharField(source='get_absolute_url', read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ('id', 'is_staff', 'email', 'username', 'password', 'url')
        read_only_fields = ('id', 'is_staff')
        extra_kwargs = {'password': {'write_only': True}}

    def create(self, validated_data):
        user = User(
            email=validated_data['email'],
            username=validated_data['username']
        )
        user.set_password(validated_data['password'])
        user.save()
        return user
```

Finally, you can overwrite default behaviours for each action of your serializer.

---

## 2.2 - Views (Class Based View)

Basically you need two class for each set of ressources.

```python
url(
    r'^users/$',
    views.Users.as_view(),
    name='users'
),
url(
    r'^users/(?P<pk>\d+)$',
    views.UsersDetail.as_view(),
    name='users_detail'
),
```

---


## 2.2 - Views (Class Based View)

The first to list and/or create (GET/POST)

```python
class Users(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    # To list ressources
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.list(request, *args, **kwargs)

    # To create a new ressource
    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.create(request, *args, **kwargs)
```

---

## 2.2 - Views (Class Based View)

The second to retrieve, update and/or delete (GET/PUT/DELETE)

```python
class UsersDetail(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    # To get/retrieve a ressource
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.retrieve(request, *args, **kwargs)

    # To update/modify a ressource
    def put(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.update(request, *args, **kwargs)

    # To delete/remove a ressource
    def delete(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.destroy(request, *args, **kwargs)
```

---


## 2.2 - Views (Class Based View)

Django Rest Framework give you two set of generic CBV (Class Based View)

 - ListAPIView
 - CreateAPIView


 - RetrieveAPIView
 - UpdateAPIView
 - DestroyAPIView

--

You can use views created from these lists. (Only with the same list)

--

#### Example:

 - ListCreateAPIView
 - RetrieveDestroyAPIView
 - RetrieveUpdateAPIView
 - RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView

--

**Note :** You need to list names in the same order as the list

---

## 2.2 - Views (Class Based View)

If generics view are too complicated for your needs, you can just use `'APIView'`

```python
from snippets.models import Snippet
from snippets.serializers import SnippetSerializer
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status


class SnippetList(APIView):
    """
    List all snippets, or create a new snippet.
    """
    def get(self, request, format=None):
        snippets = Snippet.objects.all()
        serializer = SnippetSerializer(snippets, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)
```
---

## 2.2 - Views (Class Based View)

You can also just return JSON response if you need. 

**Note :** A good API always take an action about a ressource, so basically you must work with serializer all time.


```python
from django.http import JsonResponse

class Users(...):

    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):

        data = {
            'username': 'RignonNoel',
            'password': '******************'
        }

        return JsonResponse(data)
```
---

# 3 - Essentials

1. Authorization (Basic & Token)
2. Swagger
3. Development tools
 
--

An API is use by lot of people, in some system and need to be robust. 

You need to be prepared!

---

## 3.1 - Authentication

#### HTTP Basic Authentication

Basic authentication use a tuple username/password

If you use Basic Authentication in production you must ensure that your API is only available over https.

--

#### Token Authentication

Token Authentication use a token/key to identify and allow access to the user.

Token Authentication is appropriate for client-server setups, such as native desktop and mobile clients.

**Note :** You need to write a view to GET the token with a basic authentication, so you can get and store the token of the user who use the service.

---

## 3.1 - Swagger

**OpenAPI Specification** 
(originally known as the Swagger Specification)

Specification for machine-readable interface files for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.

 - Automatically generate documentation
 - Helps keep the documentation, client libraries, and source code in sync.


`http://swagger.io/`

--

#### With Django Rest Framework : 
You can use `'Django REST Swagger'` or `'DRF Docs'`

`http://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/documenting-your-api/`

---

## 3.1 - Development tools

#### POSTMAN [Chrome]

`https://www.getpostman.com/`

Use in lot of company and project. 

 - Exportation of request/project to work with other people
 - Manage environnement variable to easily setup your environnement
 - Manage account to save project on cloud
 - Allow team works/projects

--

#### RESTClient [Firefox]

`http://restclient.net/`

A little alternative to POSTMAN
